      <description>This question probably got decided the second the Denver Nuggets took the Timberwolves to overtime for the 8th and last playoff-worthy position in West, on the last day of the regular season… but that should not stop us from looking back at what has transpired at finish line before the Playoffs with the help of some data.Teams have moved up and down the standings like never beforeTeams have switched positions a lot during the run-up of this season’s finale… and I wanted to see how abnormal this was.</description>
