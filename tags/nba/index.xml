      <description>At the time of writing this DeAndre Jordan has made 82% of his free throws (on 34 attempts) in the 2018-19 NBA regular season.
For those who did not pay attention, this might not raise many eyebrows. However, we are talking about one of the worst free throw shooters in the NBA, achieving a career 45% from the line while taking 100+ attempts every year since his rookie season.</description>

      <description>Russell Westbrook is unquestionably one of the most fun players to watch in the NBA.
Personally, he’s my favorite. His energy and raw talent can light up the court and fans around the World, with spectacular moves like this:
Russ is also known to frequently produce triple-doubles, a measure of his superhuman ability to perform in multiple areas of the game. Not everyone is into these triple-doubles though.</description>

      <description>This question probably got decided the second the Denver Nuggets took the Timberwolves to overtime for the 8th and last playoff-worthy position in West, on the last day of the regular season… but that should not stop us from looking back at what has transpired at finish line before the Playoffs with the help of some data.Teams have moved up and down the standings like never beforeTeams have switched positions a lot during the run-up of this season’s finale… and I wanted to see how abnormal this was.</description>
