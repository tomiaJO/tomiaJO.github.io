      <description>Welcome to the first post in my ‘The Big Bang Theory (Tidy)Text analysis’ mini-series, and with that, to the very first post on my blog!
Recently I was taking a class on ‘Data Science on Unstructured Text Data’, for which our final project was to create a tidyverse text analysis of any topic of our choice.
While originally I set my sight on some deep topics, I ended up with something lighter this time.</description>

      <description>This website is a personal homepage.
The site is built with Hugo—a static site generator made with Go. The website source code is available on GitHub. It uses the cocoa theme. The posts are written in Markdown.
The primary font face is Open Sans and the monospace font face is Ubuntu Mono. The social icons are from the Ionicons font set. CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using Pygments.</description>
